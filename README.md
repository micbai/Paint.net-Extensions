# Paint.net-Extensions

I couldn't find any icon extension working with the current Paint.net 5.0.13 release. In addition a big concern obviously is security.

Kudos to KyleTTucker, the Iconify extension is based on his initial code. 

Iconify is a File Extension for [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) to Save and Load Icon files with .ico file extension. 

The startup project for Visual Studio 2022 was created with [CodeLab](https://boltbait.com/pdn/CodeLab/)
