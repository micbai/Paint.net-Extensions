# Paint.net-Extensions

Iconify is a file extension for [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) to save and load Icon files with .ico file extension. 

I came up with this version because I couldn't find any icon extension working with the current Paint.net 5.0.13 release. Kudos to KyleTTucker, the Iconify extension is based on his initial code. 

The startup project for Visual Studio 2022 was created with [CodeLab](https://boltbait.com/pdn/CodeLab/)
